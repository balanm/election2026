Election prediction using Data analysis

This product will predict how to clean and prepare the dataset, create new features out of the existing ones and then predict the results using a popular machine learning algorithm
Most of the basic preprocessing, data visualization and machine learning steps have clearly explained here

First, we should load the dataset into a colab. Most ML engineers and experts prefer to use colab for machine learning and data engineering tasks in the initial stage because it is really easy to do data visualization and all other steps with a colab. I prefer to use pandas library to load the dataset because it makes all the data processing steps really easy without much effort.

Next, we should clean the dataset, fix column names and treat the missing values.
